									Before working in the LARP project for Social Wearable, I have created a few games using wearables technologies and one of those game is Armor game. </p>
									<p>I was visiting the Metropolitan Museum of Art(NY) with a friend who is also a collaborator in this project as well. It has amazing artefacts and I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to The MET. My most favourite part of the museum is the Armor exhibit. They have an awesome collection of armours from all around the world and of many different eras. We learnt about so many different armors and what are pros and cons of those armors and how they have been used through their era and wore by which ranks of soldiers. All of those information was super fascinating.  </p>
									<p>That inspired us to create something through using this armors as the inspiration but as me and collaborator Olivia were super interested on creating games with our work of wearables and after brain storming for a while we have decided to create a game by making our own armors. </p>
									<p> The game consist of 2 players wearing their armors on the whole arm and they take turns of hitting other player if a player in one swift moment hits the other playerâ€™s armor he loses one point. The first player to lose all 4 points loses the game. 	</p>
									<p>After setting up the rules of the game, we have started building our armor from the foam. We used our hands and mannequin as the structure using the measurements from our arms we used heat guns to mold the foam to our arm structure meanwhile we were also inserting pressure sensors inside the armor in order to get the hits from other player. Our scoring system was simple where we used NeoPixels attached to the side to show the scores and hits for the player.
