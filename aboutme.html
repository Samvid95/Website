									<h3 class="major">Info</h3>
									<p>I am born and raised in Ahmedabad, India. I have done my bachelors in Computer Science at L.D.College of Engineering at Ahmedabad. While studying my undergrad I started liking game desiging in general and then to pursue my Masters studies I came to United States in August 2016. I have started doing my masters in Computer Science@ NYU Tandon School of Engineering. 
										While studing at NYU, I was working with prof. Katherine Isbister at UCSC in Social Wearable projects and that made me realize that I want to do not only pure computer science work but I want to incorporate design and programming so I transferred in UCSC Computer Software and Media department under Katherine. Since then I am combining different fields 
										and creating new and innovative projects as well as I am more clear about my own research goals.
									</p>
									<p>I am trained as a computer science so I have strong technical backgrounds and I can code in many different programming languages but at the same time my interest and passion for game designer helps me see the technical work through whole different lense and innovate new ideas. 
									In summer of 2017, I had an internship at a startup which works with VR applications for architects and from there I learnt designing and development in VR since then I am in love with it. I have done a number of projects in VR.(Checkout my <a href="projects.html">projects page</a>) My biggest project currently is Social VR as it is also going to be my 
									thesis project as well. Exploring all of the Social VR domain and create awesome different interaction and understand the social norms...I am really enjoying the whole process. 
									</p>
									<p>My other hobbies are reading books, playing games and mainly playing instruments(Electronic Keyboard, Melodica, Piano). I have been playing electronic keyboard since I was in 3rd grade. I have performed in number of public gathering(specifically >500 people). I have also passed the music tests for Trinity School London for Electronic Keyboard & Organ studies. 
									I like to read books. I am an avid reader but I started reading English literature a few years back so I am still fully immersed in it. I like playing games and I play games under any genres as long as they are fun. </p>
