										<blockquote>“It's important to honor your ancestors. Bringing in a piece of furniture or an object you've inherited from a loved one not only honors the person who has passed but also brings the warmth of happy memories into your home.”</blockquote>
										<p> In August 1947, the division of India and Pakistan has forced so many people to migrate from Pakistan to India and vice-versa. It was a really a dark time in the history where many people lost their home overnight. It’s been 70 years now and the entire new generation has arrived. We learnt about this history from reading the history book but we were never relate to the hardship the people faced who had to move. </p>
										<p> In this project we have used story of a person whose grand father had to move from Pakistan to India during this time and how she remembered her. She found a suitcase that belongs to her grandfather which contains some memorabilia that’s been used by his grandfather and she is telling us the story of her grandfather and his life. </p>
										<p> This project conveys a strong narrative by use of interaction of memorabilia created inside the virtual reality environment and you can interact with them. Read those documents, listen to the stories and understand there situations about 70years ago.</p>
